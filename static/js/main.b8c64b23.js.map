In React, a fresh constructor is created, then all mixins are mixed in recursively,\n\t  // then the actual spec is mixed in last.\n\t  //\n\t  // With ES6 classes, the properties are already there, so smart-mixin mixes functions (a, b) -> b()a(), which is\n\t  // the opposite of how React does it. If we reverse this array, we basically do the whole logic in reverse,\n\t  // which makes the result the same. See the test for more.\n\t  // See also:\n\t  // https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/41aa3496aa632634f650edbe10d617799922d265/src/isomorphic/classic/class/ReactClass.js#L853\n\t  if (reactMixin.mixins) {\n\t    reactMixin.mixins.reverse().forEach(mixinClass.bind(null, reactClass));\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  return reactClass;\n\t}\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = (function() {\n\t  var reactMixin = mixinProto;\n\t\n\t  reactMixin.onClass = function(reactClass, mixin) {\n\t    return mixinClass(reactClass, mixin);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  reactMixin.decorate = function(mixin) {\n\t    return function(reactClass) {\n\t      return reactMixin.onClass(reactClass, mixin);\n\t    };\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  return reactMixin;\n\t})();\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 189 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\texports.__esModule = true;\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(4);\n\t\n\texports[\"default\"] = _react.PropTypes.shape({\n\t  subscribe: _react.PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n\t  dispatch: _react.PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n\t  getState: _react.PropTypes.func.isRequired\n\t});\n\n/***/ },\n/* 190 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\texports.__esModule = true;\n\texports[\"default\"] = warning;\n\t/**\n\t * Prints a warning in the console if it exists.\n\t *\n\t * @param {String} message The warning message.\n\t * @returns {void}\n\t */\n\tfunction warning(message) {\n\t  /* eslint-disable no-console */\n\t  if (typeof console !== 'undefined' && typeof console.error === 'function') {\n\t    console.error(message);\n\t  }\n\t  /* eslint-enable no-console */\n\t  try {\n\t    // This error was thrown as a convenience so that you can use this stack\n\t    // to find the callsite that caused this warning to fire.\n\t    throw new Error(message);\n\t    /* eslint-disable no-empty */\n\t  } catch (e) {}\n\t  /* eslint-enable no-empty */\n\t}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 191 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(4);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reduxDevtools = __webpack_require__(225);\n\t\n\tvar _reduxDevtoolsLogMonitor = __webpack_require__(581);\n\t\n\tvar _reduxDevtoolsLogMonitor2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reduxDevtoolsLogMonitor);\n\t\n\tvar _reduxDevtoolsDockMonitor = __webpack_require__(571);\n\t\n\tvar _reduxDevtoolsDockMonitor2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reduxDevtoolsDockMonitor);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj };
